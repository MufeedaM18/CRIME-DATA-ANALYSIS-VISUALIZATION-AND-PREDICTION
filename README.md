# Crime-data-analysis-visualization-and-prediction
This is my Mini project of MTech. In this project, Big Data Analytics (BDA) is used for analyzing and identifying different crime patterns, their relations, and the trends within a large amount of crime data. Here, BDA is applied to criminal data in which, data analysis is conducted for the purpose of visualization. Big data analytics and visualization techniques were utilized to analyze crime big data within the different parts of India. Here, we have taken all the states of Indian for analysis, visualization and prediction. The series of operations performed are data collection, data pre-processing, visualization and trends prediction, in which LSTM model is used.
